pensation for completing scheduled tasks. If workers are to be engaged, he posits, what does it take to turn even a rote job like packing boxes or answering phones in a call center into a meaningful and fulfilling daily experience? \n\nWhat Really Makes Up A \"Good\" Job? \n\nSchwartz points out that those people who have satisfying jobs are engaged in \"job crafting\"\u2014they are contributing to the organization in spite of their job description, not because of it. For example, a custodian at a hospital believes in the facility\u2019s mission of wellness and seeks to serve the patients and families he comes in contact with, not only by keeping the environment clean and orderly, but also by interacting with them when he can. \n\nSome might shrink from the daily grind of swabbing floors and clearing trash cans. But the way Schwartz sees it, those duties don\u2019t have much to do with the custodian having a \"good\" job. Instead, he cites several factors, in addition to believing in the organization\u2019s purpose, that contribute to overall engagement and satisfaction with the work: \n\nBroad discretion with social interaction \n\nLittle supervision \n\nChallenge to get social interactions right by using empathy, good listening, and perceptiveness of when he can have those interactions, and when it\u2019s best to stay in the background \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to turn good work into bad, Schwartz contends. \n\nBut a paycheck isn't adequate motivation, he says. He cites the work of Timothy Judge and colleagues who analyzed the results of 86 studies including 15,000 employees that, combined, suggested that the level of pay had very little effect on either job or pay satisfaction. We\u2019ve seen this play out on a smaller scale at Gravity Payments, when some employees failed to increase their happiness, even though their minimum wage was raised to $70,000. \n\nThe Pros And Cons Of Incentive Systems \n\nMore destructive than a micromanager and rote work, Schwartz writes, is the incentive. The latest calculations of the Incentive Federation\u2019s marketing survey indicate that incentives are a $76.9 billion industry. In other words, Cadillacs, steak knives, and other employee \"rewards\" are still big business. \n\nThe problem is that even though on the surface, such incentives should serve as a double motivator (I get a paycheck and then I get a bonus for doing more!), Schwartz says they have the potential to make good work bad, whether it's in a factory or call center, in a doctor\u2019s office or at a law firm. \n\nA carefully crafted incentive system designed to produce top performance can often produce the opposite\u2014competition among employees and efforts to game the system and look good on whatever metric is being used to assign pay and bonuses without actually producing the underlying results. \n\nIt seems that no matter how many times in the past we have gotten evidence that material incentives failed to produce results we sought from practicing professionals, we turn to them again the next time we want to improve quality. Somehow, systems designers repeatedly fail to appreciate that when material incentives are put front and center, other values essential to motivating employees get crowded out. And it is these other values that are responsible for excellent performance. \n\nHe points to lectures from Patrick Schiltz, a former corporate attorney turned law professor, who told his students, \"You will become unethical, a little bit at a time.\" Not by bribery or other shady practices, but through billable hours. The premium law firms place on time sheets that fill a mandatory number of hours billed to clients is what eventually could make those lawyers pad a figure here and there, promising they would pay it back to the client in the coming weeks by working at no charge. \"Then, after a while, you will stop paying back those little loans. You will convince yourself that you did such good work, your client should pay a bit more for it.\" Eventually Schiltz told his students, quick decisions made every day will \"reflect a set of values that embodies not what is right or wrong, but what is profitable and what you can get away with.\" \n\nSchwartz suggests that one of the keys to turn bad work back into good (and rewarding) work falls to executives and managers to make sure that jobs are organized around incomplete contracts where staff don\u2019t function solely within the boundaries of their job descriptions. \n\nFor example, doctors have guidelines to treat or prevent disease, but how they deal with patients is up to them. Teachers have curricula, but reaching individual students is also left to their own discretion. When teachers, for example, are incentivized based on how many students pass a certain standardized test, they will teach for that test. Scores may go up, but learning doesn\u2019t. \n\nThe solution isn\u2019t to pad job descriptions with more details or scripts and templates for desired behavior, Schwartz writes, it\u2019s the \"nurturing of workplace relationships in which people want to do right\" by the people they serve.","title":"How To Turn A Bad Job Into A Good One","media-type":"News","source":"Fast Company","published":"2015-09-24T09:12:00Z"}

I think Jackie would have liked us to do more than that. As she requested, I will not mourn her death, but rather celebrate her life. She will live on in the wonderful memories I have of her from our childhood and particularly from the last fifteen years, during which we were closer than ever. ... She wasn\u2019t just a star -- to me she was an entire galaxy.\" \n\nJoan, 82, also sheds more light on how Jackie kept her cancer diagnosis a secret from her for over five years, until it escalated to stage four breast cancer. Joan says Jackie told her the shocking news over the phone, and before that, joked that she was on a diet when Joan asked about her weight loss. \n\n\"That was typical of my sister,\" Joan recalls of the decision. \"She always put other people, particularly family, ahead of herself.\" \n\nThe British star describes her sister as a pop culture fanatic, and now celebrates \"the pleasure she gave ... to so many people.\" \n\n\"In her inimitable way she had more concern for others than for herself to the end, and anyone who knew Jackie well will tell you how courageous and selfless she was,\" Joan writes. \"This, of course, was one of the reasons for her great success in both her personal and professional life and why she was loved and admired by so many. I therefore choose to remember her as the strong, independent, loyal, caring, maternal, fun-loving, witty, joyful woman she was.\" \n\nJackie passed away at 77 years old.  She is survived by her three daughters, Tracy, Tiffany, and Rory. \n\nET caught up with Food Network host Sandra Lee at the Emmys earlier this month, who said she was \"devastated\" over Jackie's death. The news is especially personal to Lee, given that she underwent a double mastectomy in May to treat her own breast cancer.\r \n\n\"She lived her life so beautifully and we should all honor her,\" Lee said. \"She was a private person and I admire her so much.\" \n\nNEWS: 6 Reasons Why Jackie Collins Reigned Supreme \n\nWatch below: \n     You might also like       \n  MOST  POPULAR","title":"Joan Collins Pens Emotional Tribute to Jackie: 'I Don't Think I'll Ever Recover From the Sadness'","media-type":"News","source":"ETonline","published":"2015-09-28T13:57:00Z"}

The first weeks after bringing home an adopted pet are critical. It's a time to get to know one another and build a lifelong connection. Here are some steps to help ease the transition:\n\nCreate a pet-friendly environment. Keep items that are unsafe, such as chemicals and certain house plants, out of reach. Cords and objects that invite chewing also should be tucked away. If certain areas will be off limits, use baby gates to block them.\n\nExpect accidents. While house training a puppy is to be expected, you may find that an older dog needs help in this area as well. The stress of transitioning into a new household can lead to accidents, so keep this in mind and be sure to provide your new pet with lots of potty breaks, patience and instruction.\n\nStart with smart nutrition. Providing your new dog with a high-quality diet from the beginning can contribute to a lifetime of whole body health. Chose a complete, balanced food with real meat as the No. 1 ingredient, such as Purina ONE SmartBlend, so that you can be confident you're giving them the best nutrition available. \n\nIntroduce a schedule. Providing dogs with a consistent routine right off the bat can help ease their stress during the transition. Set a schedule for walks, feeding time and training so he can settle into a routine that feels a bit more familiar.\n\nApproach training with patience. Without knowing how your pet was trained, it can be difficult to predict how he will respond in his new environment. For example, he may be used to receiving treats for good behavior, while you prefer to reward with praise. Plan to be flexible, and soon you'll come to a shared understanding.\n\nEmmy-nominated actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson \n\nLearn more, and find out why more than 90,000 dog owners have decided to switch to Purina ONE, by visiting www.PurinaONE\/MakeONEDifference. \n\nVickie Rocco \n\nAbout Family Features Editorial Syndicate\n\nThis and other food and lifestyle content can be found at http:\/\/www.editors.familyfeatures.com.

{"id":"5d6bc367-9ce8-4764-923e-a6f06400739a","content":"(BPT) - Colder temperatures are on their way, but right now the weather is beautiful and that means there\u2019s still plenty of time to get outdoors and enjoy some fresh air. As an adult, spending time outside allows you to pursue passions such as landscaping, lawn games, swimming in the pool or just enjoying the company of family and friends. There\u2019s plenty to do and you know your children enjoy being outdoors just as much as you do. \n  \nHowever, when small children are outside, the potential for accidents increases. To keep them safe and make spending time outdoors an enjoyable experience for everyone, practice these four safety steps. \n \n* It starts with you. Supervising your child while you\u2019re outdoors together is the easiest way to ward off accidents, but then how do you get anything done? Start by asking your child to join you in completing the task and give them assignments they can manage such as carrying or sorting items. You can also provide toys or a new game they can play in your sight. Finally, join them in the fun. If you can\u2019t make them part of your project, make yourself part of theirs. Play their game in the backyard, swim with them in the pool or go exploring for bugs together. \n \n* Secure the area. If you want to block off a larger area like a pool or your back yard, a fence can be the answer and can make for one, final DIY project this year. Before you start however, it\u2019s important to contact your city or homeowner\u2019s association to be sure fences are allowed and to learn what type of fence you can install. Then, you need to decide if you will hire someone to install the fence or do it yourself. If you choose to do it yourself, be sure to contact your power provider so they can mark the proper power lines before you dig. \n \n* Use the right tools. A fence can keep your child safe, but eventually they\u2019ll learn to open the gate. To protect kids during these inquisitive years, D&D Technologies recently launched Magna Latch Alert, the world\u2019s first integrated alarm with new audible and visual features. Magna Latch Alert easily attaches to any gate and emits a single alert beep when the gate is opened. It will even notify you if the gate has not been securely and fully latched. Magna Latch Alert is made from high performance polymers so it won\u2019t rust in rain or snow, making it the perfect choice for any outdoor space where safety is a must. \n \n* Educate yourself. Despite your best efforts, accidents can happen and if one does, it\u2019s essential you\u2019re prepared. Make sure you\u2019re trained in CPR and mouth-to-mouth and you\u2019re aware of your child\u2019s allergies. Finally, remembering 9-1-1 is easy but you should also have the number for poison control plugged into your phone, just in case. \n \nNo matter what outdoor activity you have planned, it will be more fun if you know everyone around you is safe. Institute the four steps above and you\u2019ll be able to enjoy the rest of this year\u2019s beautiful outdoor days without a concern.","title":"4 ways to keep kids safe outdoors","media-type":"News","source":"Bloomer Advance","published":"2015-09-22T05:00:00Z"}

{"id":"c9048744-73c4-4f37-ae4d-1b48a0199c3f","content":"It\u2019s no surprise performance management is a hot topic. When I talk to HR executives and other line of business leaders, it is a top of mind issue. Add to that the expectations we all have today stemming from the use of technology in our personal lives where the apps in which we live allow us to connect, share and comment instantaneously.\n\u00a0\nAs I\u2019ve talked about regularly, those expectations have changed the way we look at technology at work as well. And they guide how we approach our application design at SAP SuccessFactors.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRe-Inventing Performance Management\n\u00a0\nIn our 2014 study with Oxford Economics, we found that younger workers \u2013 particularly those considered \u201cmillenials\u201d \u2013 want more regular feedback from managers and peers \u2013 up to 50% more than their older colleagues.\n\u00a0\nAnd HR and line of business managers are taking notice. Witness the tempest set off by Accenture\u2019s recent announcement that prompted headlines like \u201cAccenture if freeing 300,000 plus employees from performance reviews,\u201d \u201cAccenture To Nix Performance Reviews And Rankings For All 330,000 Employees,\u201d or \u201cAccenture Dumped Performance Reviews, Here is Why.\u201d It\u2019s hardly just Accenture though they are certainly a huge employer globally, so not surprising so many headlines were dedicated to them \u2013 as The New Yorker recently pointed out, Gap, Microsoft, Deloitte and others have also changed what is starting to be viewed as an outdated process around annual reviews, stack ranks and rating systems.\n\u00a0\nWe get it. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re letting our technology help you re-invent performance management. This fall, we\u2019ll introduce easier ways to recognize and reward people for performance more often, with peer-to-peer feedback loops and instantly available completely mobile. Because it\u2019s no longer just about your manager collecting feedback and then spending months consolidating, synthesizing and then subjectively and sometimes arbitrarily rating your performance.\n\u00a0\nStill, we know our customers and not everyone is making this move \u2013 some are weaving it in with more traditional annual cycles, others want to stick with processes they feel are working for them. So we\u2019ll support both. As Steve Hunt, head of customer value at SAP SuccessFactors, recently blogged, it\u2019s not a story of getting rid of performance management, or nixing, dumping or freeing from it, it\u2019s a matter of finding what works best for your company and your employees.\n\u00a0\nThe Not so Good, and the Good \u2013 Technology Won\u2019t Change Your Culture\n\u00a0\nThe story just got a lot more interesting for me, and I think for many of you too. The New York Times just published a story on Amazon, based on employee and former employee interviews, which painted a picture of an organization using instant feedback tools as tools to bully or force out employees who took leave or gave opinions not liked by colleagues, etc. I don\u2019t personally know what it\u2019s like to work at Amazon, and I expect this is a somewhat inaccurate view for many of their employees, but it points out something important in this conversation \u2013 it is not the technology but the culture that determines how tools support or hinder in the workplace. Like I say regularly, with cloud in particular making the implementation and adoption of modern, user-friendly technology happen quickly, the devil is now in the detail of change management. And HR has a huge role to play in that.\n\u00a0\nI have a personal favorite example of how instant feedback can be used in a productive, positive and engaging way. Thomas Otter, product manager for SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central, blogged about an experience he had recently when visiting a Brooks Brothers store. A few days after his visit, he was speaking at our annual user conference in Las Vegas SuccessConnect. One of his fellow speakers was from our customer Brooks Brothers. Thomas relayed the story of having recently visited their Philadelphia, PA area store and having had a great salesperson and a great experience. The executive from Brooks Brothers asked Thomas if he knew the name of the salesperson. As the story has been covered a few times now, I\u2019ll let Thomas\u2019 own words tell it,\n\u00a0\nJustin from Brooks Brothers opened the \u201cSuccessFactors app on his phone, opened the org chart and drilled down to the photo and found the store employee. He gave him kudos immediately, almost before I finished my sentence.\n\u00a0\nWith 2 or 3 clicks, probably without realising it, Justin had proven, in action, precisely what we are trying to achieve with our products. This wasn\u2019t just about EC, it was about mobile, EC, platform and talent all working together. Without our software that feedback would have been lost. Without the mobile org chart, Justin wouldn\u2019t have been able to get to the info. Without EC, he wouldn\u2019t have known precisely who was working the store.

Photo:  \n\nThe Wallabies are blessed with two of the best openside flankers in the world in Michael Hooper and David Pocock. Cheika used the duo in a tag-team role to beat the All Blacks in the opening Bledisloe Cup match in August, but the World Cup No.7 picture is no clearer. The pair played just one Test together before Cheika changed the side to keep opponents guessing. But 1999 World Cup-winning flanker David Wilson says the Wallabies will reap the rewards of a Pocock-Hooper double act because of their differing skills. \n\n\"I was always a firm believer of a balanced back row with only one of them playing,\" Wilson said. \n\n\"But they're world-class players. If you picked a world XV they'd be nipping at Richie McCaw's heels. I think you've got to pick both of them with [Scott] Fardy on the other side. \n\n\"They've got different skills that complement each other. Pocock is on the ball and Hooper's better around the paddock.\" \n\nNick Farr-Jones on the halves combination \n\nTalented: Quade Cooper. Photo: Cameron Spencer \n\nChampion halves pairings have been a hallmark of World Cup-winning sides. The Wallabies had Nick Farr-Jones and Michael Lynagh in 1991 and George Gregan and Stephen Larkham in 1999. World Cup-winning captain Farr-Jones says the biggest challenge for the Wallabies' 2015 halves partnership is to prove they are world class. \n\nThe Wallabies have readymade combinations in Queensland's Quade Cooper and Will Genia as well as NSW's Nick Phipps and Bernard Foley. They are likely to be split up as Cheika and assistant coach Larkham search for a partnership to unlock the Wallabies' attacking weapons. \n\nFarr-Jones backed Genia to get the nod ahead of Phipps and Foley in at No.10 with veteran Matt Giteau at inside centre. \n\n\"It's about rising to the occasion ??? we all know Will Genia was the best scrumhalf in the world four or five years ago. He has to find that form,\" Farr-Jones said. \"We know that Bernard Foley and Quade Cooper have to step up, this is the biggest stage in rugby and the ball is in their court. Matt Toomua can come in at No.10 as well if needed and Matt Giteau is the go-to guy at inside centre for the big matches in the tournament.\" \n\nJoe Roff on the wing battle \n\nConfident: Adam Ashley-Cooper is looking for a fairytale ending to his Test career. Photo:  \n\nThe Wallabies boast speed and power out wide, but four players will fight for one spot with Adam Ashley-Cooper all but certain to line up on one wing. \n\nOne of Australia's greatest speedsters, Joe Roff, backed international rookie Henry Speight to join Ashley-Cooper in a dynamic combination. \"If Henry Speight finds the form he had at the Brumbies, he can do big things in big moments. That wins you big games,\" said Roff, who was part of the 1999 winning side. \n\n\"I think in our back three we've got guys who can be the player of the tournament ??? Izzy Folau, Adam Ashley-Cooper is a big-game hunter. \n\n\"I had the honour of calling [Ashley-Cooper] when Cheika asked the 1999 guys to call the team and I told him he could be the player of the tournament.\" \n\nCheika recalled two-time World Cup veteran Drew Mitchell while Rob Horne has been superb for the past two seasons. Brumbies duo Speight and Joseph Tomane provide X-factor, but they are yet to prove themselves on the international stage. \n\nPhil Kearns on the Wallabies' scrum \n\nLeading from the front: Wallabies captain Stephen Moore. Photo:  \n\nEngland's 2003 World Cup-winning coach Clive Woodward fired the first shot and said the Wallabies' game plan falls apart if the scrum started going backwards. \n\nCheika has called in Argentinian hard man Mario Ledesma to stabilise the forward pack and 1991 champion Phil Kearns believes the Wallabies have started restoring pride. \n\n\"We're in a much better position now ??? but you can't really be sure until you face those big tests against England and Wales,\" Kearns said. \"But we can be far more comfortable now than we were 12 months ago in how the scrum will go.\" \n\nCheika overlooked the Wallabies' two most inexperienced props - Benn Robinson and Ben Alexander - for the tournament to start rebuilding the set piece. \n\nSkipper Stephen Moore will be the starting hooker with James Slipper, Sekope Kepu, Scott Sio, Toby Smith and Greg Holmes battling for front-row duties. \n\n\"The positive is that none of them are wildcards any more, they've all proven themselves,\" Kearns said. \"I don't think it matters who they pick for the first game. Cheik is good at defining roles for each of the players. I would probably be thinking about Sio, but it's hard to go past Slipper and Kepu to start things.\" \n\nDavid Giffin on the second row without Horwill \n\n??? \n\nWorkaholic: Rob Simmons. Photo: Reuters \n\nFormer captain James Horwill's World Cup omission was arguably the biggest selection shock in the Wallabies squad. But David Giffin, who partnered John Eales in the second row in the 1999 triumph, said Horwill's absence indicated lock depth was at an all-time high. \n\nRob Simmons is the lineout general while Will Skelton, Kane Douglas and Dean Mumm add power and experience. \n\n\"I think Rob Simmons is the first picked because he runs the lineout very, very well,\" Giffin said. \"But picking his partner is more difficult. Personally I think Will [Skelton] is best suited to impact off the bench and you'd probably go with Dean Mumm. \n\n\"I can't remember being as excited for the 2007 or 2011 World Cups. Maybe that's because I believe Australia can get through the pool and all the way to the final. We still need our slice of luck.\" \n\nThe World Cup winners' team \n\nWallabies: 15. Israel Folau, 14.

While the names of veterans Sharad Pawar and Rajeev Shukla are doing the rounds, Jharkhand\u2019s Amitabh Chaudhary, joint secretary of the Board, is likely to spoil the duo\u2019s plans as a bona fide East representative. \n \nThe likes of Pawar and Shukla may not find it easy to get backers from the East which has six votes comprising Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Odisha, Tripura and National Cricket Club. As of now, a contest looks likely as Shukla and Pawar appear keen to throw their hat into the ring. As for Pawar, the former ICC and BCCI supremo is testing waters currently and would only offer his candidature if he is sure of at least 16 votes for which he would need the support of the government. In any case, a veteran of electoral politics, Pawar is known to take decisions after long and hard deliberation. \n \nIt is learnt that former BCCI president N. Srinivasan, whose participation in Board meetings is still unclear, will have a big role as he controls as many as 10 votes in a total of 30 which is about one third. Chaudhary is known to be a Srinivasan loyalist just like treasurer Aniruddh Chaudhary of Haryana. In East Zone, Srinivasan enjoys clout in the units of Assam, Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand. For Shukla, who is known to be friends with everyone cutting across party lines, it will also be a big ask to get a proposer from the East. He may still manage to pull through if he can convince East Zone units not to field a candidate and back him as a consensus choice. \n \nMeanwhile, the upcoming special general body meeting of the BCCI may also be deferred from the proposed 15-day schedule till the BCCI gets clarity on Srinivasan\u2019s participation. Officials from East Zone had an informal discussion in the last two days and they have come to a conclusion that till 2017, the president should be someone from their own zone. \n \n\u201cThe East Zone states want that somebody from the zone becomes the president. At this point of time, Amitabh Chaudhary fits the bill perfectly,\u201d a top BCCI official from East Zone was quoted as saying by PTI. \u201cHe had been an IPS officer, has managed Jharkhand State Cricket Association , has attended AGM and is an office-bearer. \n \nAt least, four East Zone units will back Chaudhary\u2019s candidature. Our contention is till 2017 a East Zone representative should head the BCCI. One can\u2019t rule out the possibility of an election it doesn\u2019t happen. You can be rest assured if Pawar fights, CAB and NCC (kind of Dalmiya\u2019s family club) won\u2019t vote for him,\u201d the senior official added.","title":"East Zone  wants Amitabh Chaudhary as BCCI president","media-type":"News","source":"Asian Age","published":"2015-09-22T18:30:00Z"}
{"id":"723e46b3-95bf-4fbf-9f4b-cefd9057edbb","content":"\u00a0 Illustration by Ben Wade In the U.S., turning 18 years old means one can do many things: join the military, face the death penalty, \u00a0and buy lottery tickets and cigarettes \u2014 but not alcohol. The history of the legal drinking age in the U.S. is long and convoluted. After prohibition was repealed in 1933, the age of majority \u2014 the age one is legally considered an adult \u2014 was 21. But in the 1970s, when the 26th amendment dropped the voting age to 18, the drinking age fell too. In 1984, congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act which told states to change the drinking age to 21, or they would lose 10 percent of their federal highway funding. President Reagan\u2019s commission on drunk driving released the recommendation to raise the drinking age. Illustration by Ben Wade In most states, the age of majority is still 18, but the drinking age has remained 21.The United States is one of a few countries, including Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Japan, Iceland, and parts of India and Canada, with drinking ages above 18. In most countries, people can purchase alcohol at the age of 16, but must wait until 18 to purchase hard liquor. When you take a look at the rest of the world, this restriction seems archaic. Why can we vote for the president or smoke cigarettes, but not drink alcohol? To those who argue it is because our brains are not fully developed, why are we allowed to go to war and take out loans before the age of 21? Both of those actions have a life-long impact on a person\u2019s quality of life. On their website Choose Responsibility, a national organization advocating for a raise in the drinking age, \u201cAlcohol is a reality in the lives of young Americans. It cannot be denied, ignored, or legislated away.\u201d Choose Responsibility believes that young adults should be treated as such, and ignoring underage drinking leads to potentially dangerous consequences. Their website states, \u201cCurrent drinking laws infantilize young adults. We should not be surprised, then, by infantile behavior from otherwise responsible adults.\u201d We see this first-hand on UK\u2019s campus. Frat parties, tailgates and causal dorm drinking happen constantly. Earlier this semester, the Kernel editorial board wrote a piece on creating a bar on campus. \u201cUK has a responsibility to students to stop demonizing alcohol and start teaching students how to drink safely,\u201d reads the article. \u201dIf UK allows older students to drink on campus we can begin to change the culture on our campus from \u2018drinking to get drunk\u2019 to \u2018drinking responsibly.\u2019\u201d We still stand by that statement, and implore others to as well. If we are holding our university to a standard that allows responsible drinking, we must do so for our nation. opinions@kykernel.com","title":"Editorial: 18 should be legal drinking age, again","media-type":"Blog","source":"The Kentucky Kernel","published":"2015-09-22T00:59:30Z"}

{"id":"ad1dfe61-164b-4fd8-8ef3-38d676f41831","content":"By Ryan Mayer, CBS Local Sports\n\nWeek 1 of the NFL season is in the books and Week 2 gets underway tonight with AFC West divisional rivals the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs going at it in Arrowhead Stadium.  After Week 1, there are still plenty of questions about every NFL team, but we'll start to get more of those answers beginning tonight.  For a preview of what to expect we spoke with CBS Sports Radio's and former New York Giants running back Tiki Barber to get his thoughts on some of the biggest story lines as these two teams take the field tonight.\n\nPeyton Manning didn't exactly look like his usual self last week, is he beginning to show signs of his age? \n\nTiki Barber: Definitely Peyton is starting to show his age. The question now becomes how much of a burden is Gary Kubiak going to put on Manning? Peyton proved last week that you're still going to see flashes of the old Peyton Manning.  But the problem is if you're relying on those flashes to be a big part of the game every week you're going to be in trouble. \n\nIs this the week we finally get to see a Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver catch a touchdown pass?\n\nTB: (Laughing) Well, you hope that Jeremy Maclin can do what he did in the preseason and catch a touchdown pass for Alex Smith.  But, you know what the focus and strength of this Kansas City Chiefs team is and that's Jamal Charles. I think that Andy Reid understands that and tries to get the ball in his hands as much as possible. I think you'll see Charles and Travis Kelce get a lot of touches tonight, so as for Maclin catching a touchdown pass, it could happen but I wouldn't bet on it. \n\nKansas City's defense played well against Texans' QB's Brian Hoyer and Ryan Mallett in Week 1, but Peyton provides a completely different challenge. How does this defense go about trying to shut down Peyton and that offense?\n\nTB: You know, it's interesting with Peyton now because it used to be if you blitzed him, he would eat you alive, constantly changing the plays at the line. Now it seems like he's not as... like he doesn't have as much freedom, maybe, to change things at the line of scrimmage. I think because of that you're going to see Kansas City try and blitz from multiple different angles and give different looks to put the pressure on Peyton. \n\nNeither team ran the ball particularly well in Week 1. Which team needs to have that rushing game in order to come out on top?\n\nTB: Has to be CJ Anderson for the Denver Broncos. Jamal Charles will get his touches and carries, whether it's 5 carries and 10 receptions or 10-15 carries and 5 receptions he's going to get the ball.  For the Broncos Anderson has to be effective in order for Kubiak's scheme to be effective. Last week you saw between he and Ronnie Hillman had about 23 carries but they only went for about 70-80 yards. So it's not just about the volume of carries it's about being efficient with those carries as well. \n\nThe defense for the Broncos looked great last week, but we've talked about the multiple different weapons that Kansas City has, so which guy do you think needs to be the focal point of Denver's defense?\n\nTB: Clearly, it's Travis Kelce right? I mean he's become a favorite target for Alex Smith.  You saw last week there were situations where he was left wide open because of confusion in the defense and he scored two touchdowns.  You can't allow him to run wide open like that, you have to be solid in your defensive assignments. Because if you start to bring a double team on Kelce then that opens up the middle for Jamal Charles and certainly opens up the deep pass for Maclin. So I think Kelce is the guy that you have to find a way to keep under wraps early. \n\nDo the Chiefs or the Broncos look like they can compete with the defending champions in the New England Patriots and take home the AFC title?\n\nTB: I think it's still way to early to make that kind of distinction. (Laughing)  I'll tell you what though, because of the Chiefs versatility that we've mentioned and because of the defense for both the Chiefs and the Broncos, they have a chance. Kansas City with that 3-4 defense can offer such versatility and multiple looks.  I think after this game, after this week, is when we'll be able to tell a lot more about not just both of these teams, but every team in the NFL. \n\nThe Broncos and Chiefs will duel it out from Arrowhead tonight with kickoff slated for 8:25 pm on CBS.

He has tended to gravitate towards roles like Captain Jack Sparrow or the Mad Hatter and he just hasn't been \"good\" in anything since his Oscar nominated turn in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. From what I understand, that could change with his new feature and my feature of the week; Depp steps into the skin of the most notorious gangster in American history: James \"Whitey\" Bulger. Directed by Scott Cooper, Depp stars in Black Mass.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R_F-lVhSfx8\n\nWhat am I expecting to see?: From what I understand, the ingredients are there for the recipe for Black Mass to be a success. Cooper is a competent filmmaker with a respectable resume, Depp leads a relatively sturdy cast including Benedict Cumberbatch, Joel Edgerton, Kevin Bacon, Dakota Johnson, Jesse Plemons and Corey Stoll, Black Mass has a violent and grim demeanor to it and I hope that this is the movie that puts Johnny Depp back on the map as as an intense and versatile performer. I expect Black Mass to be a gripping drama.","title":"Movie of the Week: Black Mass","media-type":"Blog","source":"Jarred at the movies","published":"2015-09-14T13:29:49Z"}

He accused the Abbott government of attempting to silence critics.\n\nEnvironmental groups had been singled out ahead of other charities, he said.\n\n\"We'll be highlighting we've got a legitimate role to play in a democracy. That might be inconvenient for governments at times, but only for governments that don't have credible environmental policies.\"\n\nBut the inquiry has also heard submissions from the Minerals Council of Australia, stating some environmental groups have exploited their tax deductible status to pursue \"ideological campaigns\" and encourage illegal behaviour, such as blockades.\n\nThe Queensland Resources Council said many environmental groups were not operating within the rules of a charity or pursuing \"practical\" environmental work.\n\nThe Victorian government urged the inquiry to \"take into account the various ways in which environmental organisations fulfil their goal of improving the natural environment\".\n\nMr Wakeham said the change of prime minister was a chance to press a \"reset button\"\n\nLiberal senator Arthur Sinodinos\u200b, a key driver in Malcolm Turnbull's toppling of Mr Abbott last week, appeared on Sunday to flag a more conciliatory approach in the politics of the environment.\n\n\"I think you'll see that there'll be a bit of an end to the idea that the environment and development have to be at loggerheads, that somehow it's a zero sum game. It's not,\" Senator Sinodinos told ABC TV.\n\n\"Good environmental policies can also be good economic policies and good economic policies give you a capacity to deal with environmental issues.\"\n\nThe inquiry into the Register of Environmental Organisations has received almost 700 submissions. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"Green groups urge Malcolm Turnbull to drop Tony Abbott's tax 'vendetta'","media-type":"News","source":"Wauchope Gazette","published":"2015-09-20T06:03:08Z"}
